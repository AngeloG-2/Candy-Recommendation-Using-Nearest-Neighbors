# Candy-Recommendation-Using-Nearest-Neighbors
Unsupervised Machine Learning: What Candy do you Fancy Today? 

PURPOSE
------------------------------
Lets say you desire a candy that's chocolaty, contained almonds, and had caramel. Furthermore, lets say you had to choose from 100 different candies. It would be tedious and time-consuming to sort through each one.

The simple solution to this problem is to perform a Nearest Neighbor Search. The user will choose the characteristics they desire in a candy from a predifined set of features. The featuers from the user input will then be compared with its Nearest Neighbors in the feature space. The program will output the n nearest neighbors.

INTERPERTATION OF THE RESULTS
-----------------------------
The nearest neighbors algorithm finds the closest points from a query point. Since these objects are close together in the feature space, we can assume that the query point and the points around have somewhat similar feature values; as a result, there is a degree of similarity between those points.
